Version 1.0 -  January, 2012

 o Bugfixes
   * Missing covariates previously caused the fit to fail with a unenlightening error message. This has been corrected: now when covariates enter the model, lines with missing covariates are removed; this may cause some individuals to be removed from the dataset altogether if the corresponding covariates are missing entirely. 
    * A bug has been corrected which caused the call to saemix to fail when the dataset included covariates with values changing within an individual; a warning message has been added to inform the user that only the first value of the covariate is used in the computations
    * The computation of individual weighted and conditional weighted residuals with an exponential error model has been corrected.
    * Asking for population fits mistakingly yielded individual fits instead; this has been corrected.
    * Using an already existing directory now causes the program to overwrite previous results as the warning message implies.
    * An error in the computation of WRES for subjects with only one observation has been corrected.

 o New features
   * Binary covariates can now be entered directly as factors; if entered as strings or numbers, they will be converted to factors. Using print() on the result of saemix will show which is the reference class.
   * Plots of the data now include the option individual=TRUE to plot individual data instead of a spaghetti plot of the whole dataset ; by default a maximum of 12 subjects are plotted, but this may be overuled with the option limit=FALSE
   * A function subset has been defined for a SaemixData object.
   * A function logLik has been defined to extract the log-likelihood from a SaemixObject object.

 o Changes
   * the structure of the SaemixData object has been slightly changed: the data is now included as a data.frame. All user-level functions are unchanged.

Version 0.97 - September 13, 2011

 o Bugfixes
   * corrected a bug causing the computation of the Fisher Information Matrix (and SEs) to fail when the dataset include subjects with only one observation

Version 0.96 - July 1, 2011

 Corrected version compiling under Windows and MacOS X

 o Bugfixes
   * modified the section saving the results, using file_test() and dir.create()

Version 0.95 - June 30, 2011

 First version released on CRAN
