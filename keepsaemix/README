The SAEM package implements the Stochastic Approximation EM algorithm for parameter estimation in (non)linear mixed effects models. The SAEM algorithm: - computes the maximum likelihood estimator of the population parameters, without any approximation of the model (linearization, quadrature approximation,...), using the Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm, - provides standard errors for the maximum likelihood estimator - estimates the conditional modes, the conditional means and the conditional standard deviations of the individual parameters, using the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm. Several applications of SAEM in agronomy, animal breeding and PKPD analysis have been published by members of the Monolix group (http://software.monolix.org/).

Details concerning the algorithm, the statistical details and the data can be found in the User Guide (docsaemix.pdf in the inst directory).
